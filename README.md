# DIS for Rust

dis-rs is an implementation of the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol for Rust. It provides structures and functions to build PDUs in applications, send them out via a network and parse received byte streams into PDUs.

Constructing PDUs is done via builder pattern constructors.

Given a buffer with data from the network, the library can return multiple PDUs in multiple DIS versions present in the buffer.

The library supports both versions 6 and 7 of the standard.

## Features

Here is an overview of the DIS PDUs/features supported by dis-rs. 'Read' means reading a PDU from a byte stream. 'Write' means constructing a PDU in a struct and serializing it to a buffer.

### Enumerations
dis-rs uses the SISO-REF-010 reference to map the wire level encoding to actual names of enumerations and values in code.
E.g., one can use the enum `PduType::EntityState` in code instead of remembering that a `1` means that specific value.

The code for these enums is generated using a build script from the published SISO-REF-010.xml file. Which is currently a v30.

## Usage

### Constructing PDUs
PDUs are constructed using idiomatic `new()` or `default()` functions on the structs for `PduHeader` or `PduBody`s.
Some `PduBody` variants require the `new()` constructors to have arguments.
Further fields are set using `.with_field_name()` functions.

The main data structure is a `Pdu`, which consists of a `header` and a `body`. The body is a variant of `PduBody`, an enum that wraps a specific struct for that PDU type in a variant.
The specific body structs, e.g. an `EntityState`, can be wrapped / converted to a `PduBody` by call the `to_pdu_body()` function on the struct.
Further, the body can be merged with a `PduHeader` using the associated function `finalize_from_parts(header, body, timestamp)` of `Pdu`. This will give you a complete PDU.

### Parsing
The library exposes three functions to parse data into PDUs from a buffer: `parse()`, `parse_v6()` and `parse_v7()`.
Each function works the same, where the general `parse()` function returns all valid PDUs from the buffer and the others filter out v6 or v7 version PDUs.

### Serializing
To serialize a PDU to bytes (DIS wire format), simply call the `serialize()` function on a `Pdu`, providing the buffer as argument.

# Repositories

The library currently consists of two crates:
- dis-rs: main library containing PDU definitions and parsers, builders, etc
- dis-derive: lib containing a derive macro _previously_ used by dis-rs. Now superseded by generating enums based on SISO-REF-010. Likely to be removed or repurposed in the future.
